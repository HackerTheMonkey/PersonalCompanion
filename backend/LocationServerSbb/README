                               Version 1.0.0

This directory contains an example project to compile, package and deploy JAIN SLEE 1.1 Components 
on OpenCloud's Rhino SLEE 2.x.

The purpose of the project is to allow a developer to start developing JAIN SLEE components without 
the hassle of creating the project structure and Ant build scripts. The current directory structure 
only allows to have a component in the project per each Component Type and is NOT integrated with 
the OpenCloud XDoclet tool.

You can base your build environment in this project but bare in mind that the project is provided 
as an example only. You should careful review this build process before you install it in you 
environment.
