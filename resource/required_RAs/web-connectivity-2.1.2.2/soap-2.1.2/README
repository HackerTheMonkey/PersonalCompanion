SOAP Examples Quick Start
-------------------------

This file summarises the steps required to deploy and test the example 
SOAP services.

QUICK START:

0. Start your SLEE - $RHINO_HOME/start-rhino.sh


1. Check the listen.port property in build.properties

The listen.port specifies the port that the SOAP RA will attempt to 
listen on when it is activated, and the port the test client will send to.
The default port is 8000.  Change it if necessary your environment.


2. Deploy the examples

Using Ant, build the "deployexamples" target. This will deploy the SOAP
resource adaptor and the example SOAP services (Ping and Request).

    ant deployexamples


3. Test the Ping service

The examples include a simple SOAP client [1] which reads a SOAP envelope
from the file [2], sends the envelope to the URL represented by the SOAP RA
(http://localhost:listening-prot) and prints the response received.

The response is sent by the Ping service [3].

Use the "run-test-client" target to compile and run the test SOAP client.

    ant run-test-client


4. Test the Request service

The examples include also a SOAP client service [4] that sends the same
request. The service creates a SOAP request on activation and logs the
response sent back.

Use the "run-request" target to activate and deactivate the request service
and see the response on the Rhino log.

    ant run-request
